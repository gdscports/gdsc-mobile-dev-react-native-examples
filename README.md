A few different examples (Simple Counter & Redux Counter Example) written using React Native - using Expo.

## Requirements

- NodeJS & NPM installed
  - Android Studio

_Note:_ if wanting to build for/run on an iOS simulator, you'll need a Mac, sorry!

## Getting Started

- Run `npm install` to install the required packages
- Run `npm start` to build & start the debug app

This repo includes 2 examples. To run each one, comment/uncomment each version within `App.tsx`
